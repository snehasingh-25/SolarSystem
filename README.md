Project Title
Solar System Exploration

Project Description
The Solar System Exploration project is an interactive 3D visualization of the solar system built using Three.js. It provides users with an engaging and immersive experience by allowing them to explore the planets, their orbits, and detailed descriptions of each celestial body. This project is designed for educational purposes or as a showcase of Three.js capabilities.

Features
3D Models of Celestial Bodies: Realistic representations of planets, the Sun, and additional objects like a 3D astronaut model.
Planet Information: Clickable planets display detailed information about their characteristics.
Dynamic Animations: Smooth rotation of planets, animations for the Sun, and orbit controls for better exploration.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.
Customizable Background: Includes a starry background and environment lighting.
Technologies Used
Three.js: Core library for rendering 3D objects and animations.
GLTFLoader: To load 3D models in .gltf or .glb format.
EXRLoader: For HDR environment textures.
OrbitControls: For camera interactions like zooming, panning, and rotating.

How to Use
Planet Exploration: Click on any planet to display its name and detailed description in the UI.
Orbit Controls: Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, and right-click to pan the view.
3D Models: Watch the planets spin and explore their realistic details.
Known Issues
Lighting on Older Devices: Some devices may not support advanced lighting setups.
GLTFLoader Extension Warning: Ensure models do not use unsupported extensions like KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness. Follow instructions in the code to handle them.
Future Enhancements
Add orbits around the planets to visualize their paths.
Include moons for planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth.
Add sound effects and background music for a more immersive experience.
Display real-time data about planet positions and distances from the Sun.
